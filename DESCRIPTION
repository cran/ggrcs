Description: You can use this function to easily draw a combined histogram and restricted cubic spline. 
    The function draws the graph through 'ggplot2'. RCS fitting requires the use of the rcs() function of the 'rms' package. 
    Can fit cox regression, logistic regression. This method was described by Per Kragh (2003) <doi:10.1002/sim.1497>.
